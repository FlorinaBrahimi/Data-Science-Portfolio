# Print the string 'abc' followed by a form feed character '\f', 
# which may move the cursor to the next page depending on the environment
# The 'end' argument is set to an empty string to avoid adding a newline

# Print 'def' on the same line after the form feed

# Define a function 'findmax' that takes three arguments (a, b, c) and prints them
def findmax(a, b, c):
   # Print the values of a, b, and c
   print(a, b, c)

# Call the function 'findmax' with the values 10, 30, and 20
# The function will print these values, but it does not return anything, so it implicitly returns None
print(findmax(10, 30, 20))  # This will print 'None' because the function does not return a value
